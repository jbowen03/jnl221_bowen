			<p>I want to address the problem of the lack of clean and safe drinking water in Syracuse. On Google, I found Water and Data Reports at www.syr.gov. I skimmed a little through the report and found that they use flouride to make the water cleaner which can be harmful and also raises the question of “water freedom” since people in the city may oppose flouride but are forced to drink it on a daily basis. In addition when looking at the lead volume in drinking water, I found that between January and June of 2024, Lead and Copper sampling revealed that the water level for lead exceeded the action level of 15 ug/l (microgram per liter) in more than 10 percent of the homes tested. In order to compile more specific data, I would probably get in contact with the Syracuse Office of Management and Budget to get specific, niche numbers on the amount of money spent on water testing supplies compared to other expenses, and how much citizens of the city are paying for water. This information is essential because citizens should not be paying high prices for unclean drinking water and if they are, other expenses can probably be cut to improve the health of the city.</a> </p>
