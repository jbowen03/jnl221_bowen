Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt in the 2011 film "Moneyball", faced adversity for using a different statistical analysis to build the Oakland Athletics after taking over as the General Manager in 1997. Beane turned Oakland into one of the best teams in the American League after inheriting one of the worst organizations in baseball history.</p>

			<p> That same phrase can be said for the film industry. In the post COVID-19 era, Hollywood is shifting to an unprecedented time. Throughout the pandemic, social media influencers gained popularity as it was the only way people could communicate and stay safe.</p>

			<p> That media influence has started to become the basis for Hollywood casting following the shutdown and has drained the significance of what makes a movie star so successful.</p> 

			<p> Charles Bramesco, a film critic for The Guardian commented on the change.</p>

			<p> “The dearth of movie stars is downstream from a grander and more elaborate problem, which is the studio system’s turn away from the mid-budget vehicles that turned likeable talents into household names,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240717-glen-powell-to-zendaya-are-genuine-movie-stars-being-born-again?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">Bramesco said
			</a>.</p>

			<p>In addition, the shift away from lower budget films has proven fatal for independent filmmakers, who usually operate on a tight and stiff budget.</p>

			<p>“It’s very hard to get small-budget independent films on any subject made. So often, the sales agent will say, ‘Well who’s in it?’ It’s become about who is bankable, and it changes from day to day. Suddenly some star emerges and overnight you have to get them to get your film made,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/nov/30/richard-eyre-indie-films-bankable-stars-creative-industry?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">British director Richard Eyre said</a>.</p>

			<p>Recent data from <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/bankability" target="_blank">The Bankability Index</a> by The Numbers gives insight into how these new changes correlate to what makes someone in the film industry bankable. Sebastian Gomez, the lead data analyst for The Numbers, noted that bankability refers to the domestic value someone adds to a movie in dollar terms. It is measured primarily using the box office success of movies along with the number of Oscars and connections to other stars in the industry.</p>

			<h3>Younger Stars are more Bankable
</h3>
			<p>COVID-19 changed the way movies were experienced as the shutdown, coupled with increases in streaming services, caused a decline in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/amc-reported-loss-45-billion-2020-pandemic-clobbered/story?id=76387421" target="_blank">theater attendance</a>.</p>

			<p>“COVID flipped the story. After COVID, movies are not as successful. People are not going to the theaters as much. They decide to watch a movie on streaming or on <a href="https://greyjournal.net/news/amazon-prime-video-transformation/" target="_blank"> Amazon Prime</a>,” Gomez said. </p>

			<p>The Numbers records show that people in the film industry who are younger than 60 are 1.4 times more bankable than those who are 60 and older. To determine this, the bankability of each person in both age ranges were added up and then divided to get the value. When diving deeper into younger stars emergence on the movie screen, social media is the biggest culprit.</p>

			<iframe title="Movie stars under 60 are more bankable than those 60 and over" aria-label="Line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-a9YCJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a9YCJ/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="438" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

			<p>“You know now with social media, there’s always that one actor or one actress in general that is the popular one. Pedro Pascal, Jonathan Bailey, Margot Robbie, they are in everyone’s mouth. They [the studio] try to definitely want the person to make the movie more successful in terms of bankability,” Gomez said.</p>

			<p>One actor who has risen to fame is Glenn Powell. The 37-year-old most recently worked on Edgar Wright’s remake of <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_running_man_2025" target="_blank"> "The Running Man"</a>, which released in theaters in early November. He is also in the sports comedy <a href="https://thedailytexan.com/2025/11/02/chad-powers-fumbles-story-scores-with-humor-heart/" target="_blank"> "Chad Powers"</a>, where he plays an undercover superstar quarterback that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2hOcx4uX8" target="_blank"> Eli Manning created</a> when he tried out for Penn State in a wig and prosthetics. </p>

			<p>“While many in the new generation of up-and-comers play on our nostalgia for a glamorous past, Powell’s social media savvy and puppydog relationship have placed him ahead of the pack,’’ Bramesco said.</p>

			<p>Time will only tell if social media’s influence on a star’s bankability continues, or if it’s just a short-term shock from the COVID pandemic.</p>

			<h3>Does Film Experience Even Matter Anymore?</h3>
			<p>In addition, data from The Bankability Index concludes that someone’s bankability does not depend on how many films they work on. The average viewer might conclude that the more movies someone works on, the more they get paid. This was discovered in an <a href="https://americanfilmmarket.com/how-valuable-is-experience-when-producing-movies/" target="_blank">American Film Market Study</a> that found that on average, the level of producing experience on a movie rose with the budget.</p>

			<p>However, people in the film industry 60 and older don’t work on as many films as they used to because they just age.</p>

			<p>“In the case of people over 60, I believe that after a certain threshold, much like in any other career, actors either retire or start reducing their workload. As a result, those who remain active past 60 are generally well-established and highly recognized. They tend to be selective with the roles they take and are often involved in major projects or blockbusters,” Gomez said.</p>

			<iframe title="Bankability isn't determined by how many films someone has worked on" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-pY8L6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pY8L6/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="451" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

			<p>Despite the finding, The Bankability Index only takes into account the last ten years of work a person has done. This is a potential limitation of the data because it doesn’t accurately show the bankability of people all-time, rather just their work most recently. The Numbers chose to do this to keep its data recent and accurate, and to eliminate the need to account for inflation.</p>

			<p>“Older people probably made a movie in 2013 or 2012, but because we try to get everything up to date, we just say 10 years. Every other number that you have before that is not counted anymore,” Gomez said.</p>

			<p>For example, 2014’s "Interstellar" was a box office success, pulling in <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0816692/" target="_blank">over $200 million in the U.S.</a> The film was exempt from the Index in 2025. As a result, it caused Director Christopher Nolan and lead actor Matthew McConaughey’s bankability to drop.</p>

			<h3>Male vs. Female</h3>
			<p>Hollywood has also faced growing concerns on the pay gap between men and women in the film industry. In 2016, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/08/25/the-worlds-highest-paid-actors-2016-the-rock-leads-with-knockout-64-5-million-year/#3a67755145da" target="_blank">Forbes</a> magazine reported that the highest paid female star, Jennifer Lawrence made only 71% of what the top male star, Dwayne Johnson earned.</p>

			<p>According to the data, the average male movie star is $120,000 more bankable than the average female movie star. While female stars have been on the rise as of late, the male dominated industry still holds true with 38 out of the top 50 people on The Bankability Index being men.</p>

			<p>“The industry is mainly dominated by male actors and directors. Now, we are seeing the change where there are more female leading actors, more female directors that are making more blockbusters. I feel like right now, after COVID, that things are changing and we might see that bankability might start getting higher for female directors, female actors as well,” Gomez said.</p>

			<p>Post-COVID movies with female directors and leads have exceeded expectations at the box office. Released in 2023, "Barbie", starring Margot Robbie and directed by Greta Gerwig, pulled in <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1077904129/" target="_blank">more than $630 million domestically</a>. 2024’s "Wicked", starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo made <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1199474177/" target="_blank">nearly $500 million in the U.S.</a> with the recently released sequel, "Wicked: For Good", eclipsing <a href="https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/wicked-good-opened-no1-global-box-office" target="_blank">$145 million domestically in just the first weekend.</a></p>

			<p>“The solution is studios putting out more films with women at the center, marketing them well and audiences buying tickets. We know there is an audience for films starring women, it’s been proven with ticket sales, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/08/25/why-men-make-more-than-women-hollywood/89340644/" target="_blank">Kirsten Schaffer, executive director of Women In Film, said</a>.</p>
