     <p>I was really surprised when the police fined a man in England for covering his face when he walked past facial recognition cameras. I would have definitely done the same because I get very cautious with those types of things because I fear I could be wrongly convicted of something or be misidentified as another person. This was the same reason for the man in the film. Prior to that scene, Silkie Carlo mentioned that the biometric identity facial recognition machines in England were inaccurate nearly 98% of the time which is super high. Given that statistic coupled with the bias of AI identifiers (which I did not know existed either), that man would have most likely been convicted or arrested for an act he never did or was associated with.</p>
     <p>As someone who is big into film, I have seen AI extensively in science fiction movies. One of my favorite films is The Terminator franchise. Throughout those movies, AI is represented in humans and as robots. One main focus is the idea that AI can blend into society through the appearance and actions of human beings. Similar to the biometric identity facial recognition done in England early in the documentary, The Terminator is equipped with “targeting” humans who have committed crimes. However, The Terminator is programmed with the exact picture of the person who he must look for. The documentary on the other hand uses AI to try to identify people using descriptions, which heavily impairs the computer’s accuracy in finding the right person and contributes to arrests and convictions that should have never happened. In addition, mainstream media depicts AI as the force that will take over human jobs and will affect Americans as a whole. However, the documentary mentions how AI is used to discriminate against other races and sexes. It mentioned how Amazon used AI for job applicants and discriminated against women by rejecting applicants if they had the word woman anywhere in their application. In addition, the film mentioned that AI is used by powerful people scoring against powerless people. For example, teachers were terminated and targeted because of the algorithm with some getting fired or portrayed in a bad way.</p>
     <p>I chose incident 24: Robot kills worker at German Volkswagen plant. My hypothesis would be: The implementation of AI in vehicle automation production has a greater impact on the safety of workers than robots without AI or humans themselves. In order to prove/disprove the hypothesis, I would “ask” the dataset the following questions: 1. What percentage of the deaths in the automation sector are caused by humans or robots without AI versus those that are caused by AI automation? 2. How frequent does AI automation/robots without AI/humans go before making an error? In terms of the AI automation/robots without AI, do they need to be repaired? Updated? For humans, were they overworked, did the accident happen in overtime?</p>
